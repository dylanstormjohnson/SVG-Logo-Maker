## Description

- This project was made using Javascript, Node.js.  I was motivated to build this project because I wanted to learn more about SVGs running tests through the "npm run test" command in node.js while still creating a usable project that operated as expected.  It was built because making simple SVGs can be time consuming to write out and it would be easier to simply follow a few command line prompts and have one generated.  It is intended to solve the problem of creating your own SVGs.  In making said project, I learned about SVGs and how they are written, running tests through the command line, require(), classes and constructors, extending classes to prevent the rewriting of code, and fs.writefile's capabilities.

## Features

- This project features working Javascript coding that runs on node.js.

- When started the user is prompted with four questions about how the SVG should appear.

- Through user input, those four questions' responses are translated into text, foregroundColor, shape, and backgroundColor.

- When greater than 3 characters are provided for the text, a message appears stating that there can only be three or less characters.

- The four responses (text, foregroundColor, shape, and backgroundColor) are translated into a useable SVG which is them placed into a generated_SVGs folder.
